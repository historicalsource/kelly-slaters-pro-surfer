                     TGA2Tim2 - TGA Converter
                           v0.96 Notes
             =======================================


General Capabilities
---------------------
  - Reads TGA image files including compressed and/or palletized
  - Save files as TGA or TM2
  - Change image bit depths
	- Create and apply palette remappings between similar images


Bugs and Shortcomings
---------------------
  - ACDSee does not properly display TGAs with 32 bit palettes or 16 bit
		palettes. These files are valid however and can be viewed with
		Photoshop or other programs.
	- Relative paths in the target file specification are considered to
		be paths relative to the directory of the original file, NOT paths
		relative to the original directory.
	- Needs some speed optimizations

Command Line Options
---------------------
  tga2tim2 [-t][-r] [-b:bitdepth[,paldepth] [palopt]] [file]  [outfile]
    -t save files as TGAs
    TGA options
       -d destructive mode
       -u undo mode
		TM2 options
			 -a=align where align is either 16 or 128 - sets output file
          alignment value
		   GS options : Individual fields in the GS Registers:
          TEX0, TEX1, TEXA, TEXCLUT, FBA, PABE
			    can be set to specific values with options like:
			 --tcc=1
			    which sets the value of TEX0.TCC to 1
    -r recurse subdirectories
    -b:bitdepth[,paldepth] change color depth to bitdepth
       When bitdepth is 8 color reduction to a palette occurs. The bit
			 depth of the palette can be set with the ,paldepth option.
       Palette options
       -s:palfile save palette to palfile
       -l:palfile load palette from palfile
       -m:mapfile create a palette remapping
       -i:mapfile load and apply a remapping
    file the source TGA file to read (wildcards ok)
    outfile the output filename (defaults to *.TM2)


Filenames
---------------------
  By default the program reads all the TGA files in the current
  directory and saves them in TM2 format with the same name and
  a TM2 extension.

  The input file command line parameter allows a specific file or
  set of files to be processed. The parameter supports the standard
  DOS wildcard characters ? and *, and can include a directory path.

  Input files are recusively searched for from the current directory
  or the directory of the specified input file when the -r parameter
  is used.

	Input files with a TM2 file extension will be loaded as TM2 files
	instead of TGA files. Note that the program has not been extensively
	tested with TM2s as input files so unexpected results are possible.

  The output file command line parameter controls can be used to
  indicate the output file names. In addition to the normal wildcard
  characters, the output file name can contain the following string
  replacement macros:
   Macro Replaced with
   ----- ---------------
    %v   The drive letter of the input filename
    %p   The path of the input filename
    %n   The base name of the input filename
    %e   The extension of the input filename

  Files can be saved in TGA format by using the -t parameter. If no
  output file parameter is used with this option, the default action
  will be to save the file with the same name. The original file
  is renamed with a TGC extension unless the -d option is used in
  which case it is deleted. The backed up TGC files can be restored
  using the -u option.

  In general any paths specified on the command line will work with
  either forward slashes or backslashes for compatibility with UNIX
  make files. The only case where this fails is for names whose first
  character is a forward slash that could be interpreted as a command
  line flag.

  Long filenames with embedded spaces should be wrapped in quotes.

		--l=<num>    Sets the TEX1.L    field to <num>
		--k=<num>    Sets the TEX1.K    field to <num>

		TEXA register
	  --ta0=<num>  Sets the TEXA.TA0 field to <num>
	  --aem=<num>  Sets the TEXA.AEM field to <num>

Changing Bitdepths
---------------------
  When converting an image to a palettized bitdepth with the -b:8
  parameter, the program will make an initial pass through all the
  input files and generate a single shared palette palette. A second
  pass converts the files to this single palette. The bit depth of
	the palette can be set by adding the depth to the end of the -b
	parameter. For example -b:8,32 will result in a 32 bit palette.

	Palettizing effectively quantizes all colors to 6 bits.

  The generated palette can be saved to a file (proprietary format)
  with the -s:<filename> parameter.

  A previously generated palette saved with the -s parameter can be
  loaded and and used as the target palette with the -l:<filename>
  option.


Palette Index Maps
---------------------
  When two images or sets of images are essentially the same except
  for their palettes then it should be possible to only load one
  of the files and switch palettes to draw the other.

  For this to work the palette indexes of the second set of images
  may need to be sorted for the palette to work with the first set
  of images. TGA2TIM2 is capable of doing this.

  To generate the appropriate palette reindexing use the
  -m:<mapfilename> parameter, and specify the file you wish to match
  in place of the input file and the file that should match it in
  place of the output file. This will not change either or the files,
  but it will generate a file named whatever <mapfilename> was.

  To actually change the files run the program again using the
  -i:<mapfilename> parameter and specify the file(s) to convert as
  the input file.

  If the two images do not match exactly, the program will print
  warnings.
