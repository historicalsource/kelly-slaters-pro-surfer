The MSCV++ workspace and project files have been broken for some time and I 
have not found anyone willing to fix them or provide new ones. I hope the
following instructions will be sufficient for Win32 to users to build, test
and use this library.

It is assumed that when you unzip the source code package you will keep the
directory structure of the archive.

The source code for the library it self is in following directories under 
the main libsndfile directory:

		src/
		src/GSM610/

To build the library you need to create a project containing all the *.c files 
in these two directories. In addition, you should copy the two header files
in the Win32/ directory (config.h and unistd.h) to the src/ directory. In the
case of config.h you will be overwriting the existing config.h file.

The test programs are all in the directory tests/ which contains one .c file
for each test program. To create all the test programs you will need to 
compile each of these test programs and link it to the library.

Finally, there is also a directory examples/, which contains a number of small
example programs. These can be compiled and linked much like the files in the
tests/ directory.

Anybody who can add to or clarify these instructions should should send me 
email at <erikd@zip.com.au>.
