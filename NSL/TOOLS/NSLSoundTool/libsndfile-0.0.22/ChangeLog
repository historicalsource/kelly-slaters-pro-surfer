    See the ChangeLog in this directory for details.
    
    * src/au_g72x.c
    New file for G721 encoded AU files.
    
2000-07-08  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    Added a spec file for making RPMs. Thanks to Josh Green for supplying this.

2000-06-28  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.c src/sndfile.h
    Add checking for and handling of header-less u-law encoded AU/SND files.
    Any file with a ".au" or ".snd" file extension and without the normal

    * src/au.h
    New function for opening a headerless u-law encoded file for read.
    
2000-06-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    with some files.

2000-03-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Added option to test PCM WAV files (sanity check).
    Fixed bug in sf_seek() tests.

2000-02-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.c src/wav.c
    Minor changes to allow writing of GSM 6.10 WAV files.

2000-02-28  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * configure.in Makefile.am src/Makefile.am
    Finally got around to figuring out how to build a single library from 
    multiple source directories.
    Reading GSM 6.10 files now seems to work.

2000-01-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c
    Added more error reporting in read_fmt_chunk().

1999-12-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    Moved code around in preparation to adding ability to read/write IMA ADPCM
    encoded AIFF files.

1999-11-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/common.c
    Fixed put_int() and put_short() macros used by _psf_hprintf() which were 
    causing seg. faults on Sparc Solaris.

1999-11-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/common.c
    Added string.h to includes. Thanks to Sigbjxrn Skjfret.
    
    * src/svx.c
    Fixed __svx_close() function to ensure FORM and BODY chunks are correctly
    set.

1999-10-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/au.c
    Fixed handling of incorrect size field in AU header on read. Thanks to 
    Christoph Lauer for finding this problem.

1999-09-28  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed a bug with incorrect SSND chunk length being written. This also lead
    to finding an minor error in AIFF header parsing. Thanks to Dan Timis for 
    pointing this out.

1999-09-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/paf.c
    Fixed a bug with reading and writing 24 bit stereo PAF files. This problem
    came to light when implementing tests for the new functions which operate
    in terms of frames rather than items.

1999-09-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Modified file type detection to use first 12 bytes of file rather than 
    file name extension. Required this because NIST files use the same 
    filename extension as Microsoft WAV files.
    
    * src/sndfile.c src/sndfile.h
    Added short, int and double read/write functions which work in frames rather 
    than items. This was originally suggested by Maurizio Umberto Puxeddu
    
1999-09-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/svx.c
    Finished off implementation of write using __psf_hprintf().

1999-09-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/common.h
    Added a buffer to SF_PRIVATE for writing the header. This is required
    to make generating headers for IFF/SVX files easier as well as making
    it easier to do re-write the headers which will be required when 
    sf_rewrite_header() is implemented.

    * src/common.c
    Implemented __psf_hprintf() function. This is an internal function
    which is documented briefly just above the code.
    
1999-09-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed a bug in sf_write_raw() where it was returning incorrect values
    (thanks to Richard Dobson for finding this one). Must put in a test 
    routine for sf_read_raw and sf_write_raw.
    
    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed default FORMsize in __aiff_open_write ().

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added copy of filename to internal data structure. IFF/SVX files 
    contain a NAME header chunk. Both sf_open_read() and sf_open_write()
    copy the file name (less the leading path information) to the
    filename field.
    
    * src/svx.c
    Started implementing writing of files.

1999-08-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/svx.c
    New file for reading/writing 8SVX and 16SVX files.

    * src/sndfile.[ch] src/common.h
    Changes for SVX files.
    
    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed header parsing when unknown chunk is found.
    
1999-08-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/paf.c
    New file for reading/writing Ensoniq PARIS audio file format.
    
    * src/sndfile.[ch] src/common.h
    Changes for PAF files.
    
    * src/sndfile.[ch]
    Added stuff for sf_get_lib_version() function.


1999-07-31  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.h MacOS/config.h
    Fixed minor MacOS configuration issues.

1999-07-30  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * MacOS/
    Added a new directory for the MacOS config.h file and the
    readme file.

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed calculation of datalength when reading SSND chunk. Thanks to
    Sigbjørn Skjæret for pointing out this error.

1999-07-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.c src/sndfile.h src/raw.c
    Further fixing of #includes for MacOS.

1999-07-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added call to ferror () in main header parsing loop of __XXX_open_read
    functions. This should fix problems on platforms (MacOS, AmigaOS) where 
    fseek()ing or fread()ing beyond the end of the file puts the FILE*
    stream in an error state until clearerr() is called.
    
    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for RAW header-less PCM files.
    
    * src/common.h
    Moved definition of struct tribyte to pcm.c which is the only place
    which needs it.

    * src/pcm.c
    Modified all code which assumed sizeof (struct tribyte) == 3. This code
    did not work on MacOS. Thanks to Ben "Jacobs" for pointing this out.

    * src/au.c
    Removed <sys/stat.h> from list of #includes (not being used).
    
    * src/sndfile.c
    Added MacOS specific #ifdef to replace <sys/stat.h>.
    
    * src/sndfile.h
    Added MacOS specific #ifdef to replace <sys/stat.h>.
    
    * src/sndfile.h
    Added MacOS specific typedef for off_t.
    
    * MacOS-readme.txt
    New file with instructions for building libsndfile under MacOS. Thanks
    to Ben "Jacobs" for supplying these instructions.
    
1999-07-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * configure.in
    Removed sndfile.h from generated file list as there were no longer
    any autoconf substitutions being made.
    
    * src/raw.c
    New file for handling raw header-less PCM files. In order to open these
    for read, the user must specify format, pcmbitwidth and channels in the
    SF_INFO struct when calling sf_open_read ().
    
    * src/sndfile.c
    Added support for raw header-less PCM files.    
    
1999-07-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * examples/sfinfo.c
    Removed options so the sfinfo program always prints out all the information.
    
1999-07-19  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/alaw.c
    New file for A-law encoding (similar to u-law).
    
    * tests/alaw_test.c
    New test program to test the A-law encode/decode lookup tables.
    
    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Added tests for a-law encoded WAV, AU and AULE files.
    
1999-07-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.c src/au.c
    Removed second "#include <unistd.h>". Thanks to Ben "Jacobs" for pointing
    this out.

1999-07-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * tests/ulaw_test.c
    New test program to test the u-law encode/decode lookup tables.

1999-07-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.h
    Made corrections to comments on the return values from sf_seek ().
    
    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed boundary condition checking bug and accounting bug in sf_read_raw ().

1999-07-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/au.c src/ulaw.c
    Finished implementation of u-law encoded AU files.
    
    * src/wav.c
    Implemented reading and writing of u-law encoded WAV files.

    * tests/
    Changed name of adpcm_test.c to lossy_comp_test.c. This test program
    will now be used to test Ulaw and Alaw encoding as well as APDCM.
    Added tests for Ulaw encoded WAV files.

1999-07-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * tests/adpcm_test.c
    Initialised amp variable in gen_signal() to remove compiler warning.
    
1999-07-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/aiff.c
    In __aiff_open_read () prevented fseek()ing beyond end of file which 
    was causing trouble on MacOS with the MetroWerks compiler. Thanks to
    Ben "Jacobs" for pointing this out.
    
    *src/wav.c
    Fixed as above in __wav_open_read ().

1999-07-01    Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav_ms_adpcm.c
    Implemented MS ADPCM encoding. Code cleanup of decoder.
    
    * tests/adpcm_test.c
    Added tests for MS ADPCM WAV files.

    * tests/read_seek_test.c
    Added test for 8 bit AIFF files.

1999-06-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Removed test for IMA ADPCM WAV files which is now done in adpcm_test.c

    * configure.in
    Added -Wconversion to CFLAGS. 
    
    * src/*.c tests/*.c examples/*.c
    Fixed all warnings resulting from use of -Wconversion. 

1999-06-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c
    Added fact chunk handling on read and write for all non WAVE_FORMAT_PCM
    WAV files.

    * src/wav_ima.c
    Changed block alignment to be dependant on sample rate. This should make
    WAV files created with libsndfile compatible with the MS Windows media
    players.
    
    * tests/adpcm_test.c
    Reimplemented adpcm_test_short and implemented adpcm_test_int and adpcm_test_double.
    Now have full testing of IMA ADPCM WAV file read, write and seek.

1999-06-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav_float.c
    Fixed function prototype for x86f2d_array () which was causing ocassional

    not being correctly calculated before writing.
    
    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Modified to detect the above bug in WAV, AIFF and AU files.

1999-06-12    Erik de Castro Lopo     <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * Win32/*
    Added a contribution from Albert Faber to allow libsndfile to compile
    under Win32 systems. libsndfile will now be used as part of LAME the
    the MPEG 1 Layer 3 encoder (http://internet.roadrunner.com/~mt/mp3/).

1999-06-11    Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * configure.in
    Changed to reflect previous changes.
    
    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Fixed incorrect calculation of bytespersec header field (IMA ADPCM only).
    
    Fixed bug when writing from int or double data to IMA ADPCM file. Will need 
    to write test code for this.
    
    Fixed bug in __ima_write () whereby the length of the current block was 
    calculated incorrectly. Thanks to Jongcheon Park for pointing this out.

1999-03-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/*.c
    Changed all read/write/lseek function calls to fread/fwrite/
    fseek/ftell and added error checking of return values from
    fread and fwrite in critical areas of the code.
    
    * src/au.c
    Fixed incorrect datasize element in AU header on write.
    
    * tests/error_test.c
    Add new test to check all error values have an associated error
    string. This will avoid embarrassing real world core dumps.

1999-03-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added handling for unknown chunk markers in the file. 

1999-03-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Filled in missing error strings in SndfileErrors array. Missing entries 
    can cause core dumps when calling sf_error-str (). Thanks to Sam 
    <mrsam at-sign geocities.com> for finding this problem.

1999-03-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Work on wav_ms_adpcm.c uncovered a bug in __ima_read () when reading 
    stereo files. Caused by not adjusting offset into buffer of decoded
    samples for 2 channels. A similar bug existed in __ima_write ().
    Need a test for stereo ADPCM files.
    
    * src/wav_ms_adpcm.c
    Decoder working correctly.
    
1999-03-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * configure.in Makefile.am
    Added --enable-justsrc configuration variable sent by Sam
    <mrsam at-sign geocities.com>.
    
    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Fixed bug when reading beyond end of data section due to not
    checking pima->blockcount.
    This uncovered __ima_seek () bug due to pima->blockcount being set 
    before calling __ima_init_block ().

1999-03-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c
    Started implementing MS ADPCM decoder. 
    If file is WAVE_FORMAT_ADPCM and length of data chunk is odd, this
    encoder seems to add an extra byte. Why not just give an even data
    length? 

1999-03-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c
    Split code out of wav.c to create wav_float.c and wav_ima_adpcm.c.
    This will make it easier to add and debug other kinds of WAV files
    in future.

    * tests/
    Added adpcm_test.c which implements test functions for
    IMA ADPCM reading/writing/seeking etc.

    * src/wav.c
    Fixed many bugs in IMA ADPCM encoder and decoder. 
    
1999-03-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c
    Finished implementing IMA ADPCM encoder and decoder (what a bitch!). 
    
1999-03-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c
    Started implementing IMA ADPCM decoder. 

1999-03-02  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed bug where the sf_read_XXX functions were returning a 
    incorrect read count when reading past end of file.
    Fixed bug in sf_seek () when seeking backwards from end of file.

    * tests/read_seek_test.c
    Added multiple read test to short_test(), int_test () and
    double_test ().
    Added extra chunk to all test WAV files to test that reading
    stops at end of 'data' chunk.

1999-02-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for little DEC endian AU files.

    * src/au.c
    Add handling for DEC format little endian AU files.
     
1999-02-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/aiff.c src/au.c src/wav.c
    Add __psf_sprintf calls during header parsing.
     
    * src/sndfile.c src/common.c
    Implement sf_header_info (sndfile.c) function and __psf_sprintf (common.c).

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for 8 bit PCM files (WAV, AIFF and AU).

    * src/au.c src/aiff.c
    Add handling of 8 bit PCM data format.
     
    * src/aiff.c
    On write, set blocksize in SSND chunk to zero like everybody else.
    
1999-02-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/pcm.c:
    Fixed bug in let2s_array (cptr was not being initialised).

    * src/sndfile.c:
    Fixed bug in sf_read_raw and sf_write_raw. sf_seek should
    now work when using these functions.

1999-02-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * tests/write_read_test.c:
    Force test_buffer array to be double aligned. Sparc Solaris
    requires this.

1999-02-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/pcm.c:
    Fixed a bug which was causing errors in the reading
    and writing of 24 bit PCM files.
    
    * doc/api.html
    Finished of preliminary documentaion.

1999-02-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/aiff.c:
    Changed reading of 'COMM' chunk to avoid reading an int
    which overlaps an int (4 byte) boundary.
